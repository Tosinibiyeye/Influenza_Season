# INFLUENZA_SEASON
# Project Overview
The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual
suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious
complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to
adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary
staff.
# Objective: 
Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.
# Scope:
The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and
the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season.
# Stakeholder Question
● Provide information to support a staffing plan, detailing what data can help inform the timing
and spatial distribution of medical personnel throughout the United States.
● Determine whether influenza occurs seasonally or throughout the entire year. If seasonal,
does it start and end at the same time (month) in every state?
● Prioritize states with large vulnerable populations. Consider categorizing each state as low-,
medium-, or high-need based on its vulnerable population count.
● Assess data limitations that may prevent you from conducting your desired analyses.
